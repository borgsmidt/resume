### About me
Currently working as a software consultant on customer projects.

Nearly 20 years of experience as a software professional, for the most part building financial planning software for the enterprise. Lead developer and maintainer for many years of the J Calculation Engine, a component central to most operations in **IBM Cognos Planning**. Also co-invented several key features of this product.

Bachelor of Computer Science from University of Copenhagen (1994–1997, 2010–2014). A bachelor's thesis was submitted in June 2013 and was graded 12 (top mark). The thesis titled _Functional Array Programming Compiled to a Virtual Machine_, may be downloaded from [http://borgsmidt.dk/public/functional\_array\_programming.pdf]().

Named inventor and co-inventor on several issued patents.

Experience with a broad suite of technologies and methodologies, including Java 8, C#, JavaScript, Erlang, Ruby, APL/J, functional programming languages, as well as runtime code generation of MSIL, JBC and x86 machine code.

Enjoys tinkering with JavaScript, Erlang and Ruby — and AngularJS, which has brought a clean and healthy sense of modularity and code separation to the world of clientside JavaScript.

Avid practitioner of test-driven development and similar outside-in modes of thought.

Experience as Team Captain and Scrum Master of a highly distributed development group with members across four time zones.

Lived five years abroad in the UK and Luxembourg.

Specialties: Enterprise software development, calc/modeling engines, object model design, API design, financial planning software, collaboration, object-oriented analysis and design, test-driven development, dynamic code generation, structured refactoring and performance optimization.
